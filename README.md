## Museum Heist

### Abstract

In this work, we introduce Museum Heist, a social deduction game that utilizes homo- morphic encryption and zkSNARK to maintain the privacy of sensitive information. This game aims to overcome the challenges of hiding private information on a blockchain, such as transparency, lack of anonymity, and the difficulty of implementing the social aspect of the game. We show that by using homomorphic encryption and zkSNARK, it is possible to perform private verifiable state updates and read the latest state without knowledge of the original state or intermediate transition paths. This allows for more control over private read-write access and increased flexibility in state transitions.
